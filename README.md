<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![JoviToken](images/screenshot.png)](https://jovitokenico.joviandsouza.repl.co/)

JoviToken is an ERC20 based token currently deployed on the Ethereum Goerli testnetwork. This token is for learning purposes only. ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible token is one that is interchangeable with another token. This repo includes the website for the Presale and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for JoviToken. 

For Smart Contract implementation follow [JoviTokenIco-contracts](https://github.com/Jovian-Dsouza/JoviTokenIco-contracts)

Here are some cool features of this crowdsale:

* Minted Crowdsale : Instead of having  a fixed supply the tokens are minted according to the total purchase
* Capped Crowdsale : adds a cap to your crowdsale, invalidating any purchases that would exceed that cap
* Individually Capped Crowdsale : Caps an individual's contributions
* Timed Crowdale : Allows buying of token in a certain time interval only
* Refundable Crowdale : Refunds the buyer if the Goal is not reached
* Token Time Vesting and Token Distribution
* Testcases to make sure that the smart contract is working correctly
